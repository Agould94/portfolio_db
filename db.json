In this essay, I aim to explain their capabilities, significance and present some possible ideas of where they could be heading in the future. I aim to imagine and build a more beautiful, empowering, just, and equitable world. I believe that Blockchain technology is a necessary aspect of such a future.</p>\nI have been interested in and invested in various blockchain companies for several years. I have followed the steady rise of these currencies, from humble beginnings, where they were an odd novelty of the internet. Today, the market cap or total amount of Bitcoin in circulation is worth over a <em>trillion dollars.</em> Anything that in aggregate is worth a trillion dollars is undoubtedly a significant force. Why is this technology worth so much? What makes it valuable? And how is this such a significant technological advancement that it could change civilization? Let’s explore these questions.</p>\n<h3>The myth of money.</h3>\nMoney is not real. Money is simply a representation of trust in the ability to acquire <em>things</em>. The things are real; food, clothing, technology, vehicles, services, etc., but the money used to obtain them is nothing more than a means of exchange. It allows people to trade their work, goods, or services for the <em>trust</em> that they will, in turn, be able to trade that trust for the goods, services, or work provided by others in the future. We hold on to money to which we assign value, and it allows the market of all possible goods and services to grow in unique and dynamic ways: any individual can do one thing for money and have access to all things through his money.</p>\nPeople exchanged using gold and silver throughout much of human history. These precious metals held unique properties such as low melting points and high purity degrees, meaning they could not mix well with other metals. Most importantly, these resources were scarce. There was only so much gold and silver available globally, and the mining process was difficult, often treacherous, and always time-consuming.</p>\nUntil 1971, all money in the United States was <em>backed</em> by gold, meaning any dollar was worth a certain amount of gold, and you could hypothetically exchange it for that gold at any time. Of course, the gold was just a store of trust like any other currency; if you held a piece, you could be sure that someone, somewhere, would want to buy it from you in exchange for money, goods, or services.</p>\nAll civilizational history and technological advancement have progressed through complex exchange, and money is simply an abstraction of that exchange. We often forget this and focus on the accumulation of money. What we <em>truly</em> want is the accumulation of <em>things</em>, access to <em>services</em>, and <em>experiences</em>. Money confers the ability to get these things that we truly want. We use it to exchange one type of thing, say giving a haircut, for a different kind of thing; buying a hamburger. Money is the intermediator of this exchange. Unless you were cutting the hair of a chef in exchange for free burgers, this exchange could not take place without the intermediating money.</p>\n<h3><strong>So what’s different about blockchain?</strong></h3>\nThe US federal reserve mints and distributes money into the economy. It assigns every dollar a unique id and keeps track of all the money in circulation- at least in theory. It does this through a complex system of banks, which receive money from the fed, invest it in corporations, philanthropic endeavors, employing workers for various projects, etc.</p>\nThe purpose of banking is to keep track of all the money in circulation by keeping track of how much money flows into and out of the bank in any given year. This record-keeping happens through physical, or computer-empowered counting, and there is an entire profession dedicated to counting and keeping tabs on the circulation of money for the government; accounting. Complicated models are used to estimate and understand who spent what where. Often, significant and influential portions of the economy go unaccounted for.</p>\nThis mis-accounting is what precipitated the financial crash of 2008. Through credit, banks were lending money to people who could not pay it back properly. As these people defaulted on their loans, the bank’s ledgers began to show that they had far less money coming in than going out. The crash was a failure of many systems at once; of creditors, accountants, and reliance on a system of banks to prop up the economy and regulate the inflow and outflow of currency.</p>\nBlockchain is different because it keeps a perfect and precise account of the exact amount of money in circulation on a given blockchain. The blockchain does not require human intervention to keep track of where money, or trust, is allocated. If a blockchain service was able to lend money — a service provided by companies like <a href=\"https://compound.finance/governance/comp\">Compound</a>- it could ensure that it never lent more than it was capable of lending or more than its borrowers were able to pay back.</p>\nThis certainty is made possible because the blockchain keeps a detailed account of the amount of cryptocurrency held by the lender and the amount held by the borrower, who can stake their currency as collateral. This precise accounting takes place through the manipulation and movement of data on a <em>distributed ledger</em>- which is essentially a public list that anyone can read. The ledger keeps a record of every transaction made with a given coin, or piece of cryptocurrency, traced back to the point when it was minted.</p>\nThe second reason blockchain technology, and more precisely, cryptocurrency, is different is its creation process. Coins, or the pieces of currency circulating on the ledger mentioned above, are created through a novel <em>cryptographic </em>process that conveys uniqueness upon the individual coins. Like gold, these coins hold unique properties that make them valuable on the internet and in real life.</p>\nChief among these properties is the fact that each currency is <em>non-fungible</em> or unique. Until the advent of cryptocurrency, there was no way to maintain uniqueness on the internet. Post an image, video, document, or series of numbers, and others could copy them thousands of times; nothing was proving or stating which copy was real, and therefore there was no such thing as the ‘real’ thing over the internet.</p>\nPrior to cryptocurrency, the best alternative was to provide users private accounts with passwords where they stored information that was ‘theirs.’ In the context of banking, this meant storing bits of information on a screen as data: money stored as numbers held in a specific account under a user profile. Like the dollar bills that came before them, these numbers were simply a <em>representation </em>of our ability to exchange. We trusted these banks to back our accounts with real dollars; we could go to an ATM and withdraw this money or use a debit card to transfer the numbers in our account into someone else’s account. Where the federal reserve backed physical dollars, virtual dollars are generally the domain of whichever bank keeps track of them. There is nothing intrinsically unique about the numbers we see when we log into our online bank accounts.</p>\nThey are simply representations of the information accounted for by the bank that we use. The bank must keep this account because, until recently, there was no other way to verify that the dollar that we had in virtual space was, in fact, a <em>real</em> dollar. If the bank did not keep track of all the dollars people had in their accounts; the monetary system would have been in chaos. People could just say that they had a certain amount of money and we would have no way to verify the legitimacy of their claims. There would be no certainty or clarity. People would have been trading fools gold for gold, and there would have been no possibility of internet banking.</p>\nUntil now, the banks have been a vital aspect of the internet economic system because there was no other way of assigning uniqueness and keeping track of virtual dollars. All of that changed with cryptocurrency; it uses a method of <em>cryptography</em>, or encryption, which enables a coin, or a piece of currency, to be unique. Each coin is a unique code: a hidden string of numbers that is statistically impossible to replicate by any computational method. This code is a series of numbers arrived at through complex computational calculations.</p>\nThe uniqueness of the coin and the distributed ledger that it creates and is traded upon mean a record of each unique coin throughout its entire transaction history is kept. A new version of this leger is created every few minutes. The ledger is updated with legitimate transactions each time. Updating the ledger through illicit means: the crypto equivalent of a bank robbery is next to impossible as it would not only require the same amount of computing power necessary to create the original coin but would require a high degree of luck, as the unique code of each coin is a <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-hashing/\">256 digit number</a> that is computationally complex to arrive at even under the best circumstances.</p>\nThe ledger keeps records over long periods of time, and the code behind the leger always defaults to the longest-maintained leger. Anyone trying to steal a cryptocurrency would need to put in the computing power required to maintain this leger indefinitely. Each coin is paired with a key that ascribes ownership, and a would-be thief would need to copy the creation of that unique key, which is also statistically highly unlikely.</p>\n<h3>Banking without the banks.</h3>\nAll of this is to say that the original blockchain whitepaper penned by the infamous Satoshi Nakamoto provided a means to do internet and online banking <em>without the banks</em>. It allows for a system that cuts out the need for accountants and can maintain a precise ledger of trust in one’s ability to exchange. This trust, paired with coin non-fungibility and scarcity, means that the individual coins traded over the blockchain carry a uniqueness that one cannot find even in today’s dollars.</p>\nCryptocurrency is compared to gold because it has intrinsic properties that render it valuable. Nobody can copy it. It provides a framework upon which organizations and individuals can build all sorts of other technologies. Ethereum does this in terms of smart contracts. The recent NFT boom has extended this framework to digital artwork, enabling artists to create and sell unique, non-copyable, and traceable-to-source versions of their artwork online. These intrinsic properties make the online currencies carry real value and have already begun to revolutionize the way we think about money and how traditional banking is done.</p>\nOver time, these currencies could precipitate a complete decline and fall of the banking industry. These institutions would no longer be necessary to maintain and execute a record of transactions. We would not need banks to instill value by way of trust in any individual’s stored currency. A person can simply carry a ‘wallet’ that stores the unique keys that link their account to a cryptocurrency piece maintained by the distributed ledger. Paying someone means updating the ledger, and only this is necessary to keep a clear and precise record of transactions throughout history.</p>\nOne can imagine applications in taxation, corporate ownership, governmental regulation, credit, and social activism, to name a few. The applications of this technology are potentially endless, and I aim to explore and engage this new technology through understanding it intimately and applying it to the areas of social governance of both the internet and the real world.</p>\n<h3><strong>The future of governance.</strong></h3>\nMany blockchain organizations are already experimenting with the decentralized governance of their unique platforms. The power of the decentralized ledger allows individuals who hold a stake in a given blockchain -those who own a coin on that chain — to vote on protocols regarding the chain if a majority of stakeholders vote in favor of a given change. These changes could be an update to code or a fork of the blockchain.</p>\nI have oversimplified on-chain governance protocols used by blockchains such as <a href=\"https://tezos.com/\">tezos</a>, which aims to build an open consensus on all changes made to their blockchain. I am interested in this concept and in working at the cutting-edge of this field. I want to engage with the blockchain, develop on it, and communicate with those who are continuing to explore it in novel ways.</p>\nWhat if we were able to encode democratic governing principles onto the internet itself? What if we could use data to regulate e-commerce and a blockchain to tax that commerce in novel ways? Could we create the decentralized economy that is the true promise of blockchain? If we achieved this kind of economy, what would it mean for politics and government?</p>\nThe internet has already radically transformed the way we do politics and government. Movements can pop up overnight and enrapture hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. Divisive figures can monopolize attention by understanding and manipulating the algorithms that govern social media. The new world that we now inhabit has rendered the best opinions on government incompetent and outdated.</p>\nDivision is the enemy of progress, but it is only through progress that we will ever solve division. There is no going backward in life- particularly not in the field of technology. Too many lives and dollars are at stake to seriously regulate the technologies that now service every aspect of our world. Further, these marvelous technologies have caused at least as much good as they have harmed. If we can’t get rid of them, then they are here to stay. This means that we must continue to innovate and create better ways of integrating these technologies into our daily activities.</p>\nWe must use the internet and its related technologies to govern the internet. We must discover ways of empowering every individual to be as complete a part of the world’s progress as any other. In the beginning, what we need are technological solutions, ones that can give rise to a new type of politics and a new kind of government.</p>\nThe beauty of the internet is that we can start small, scale over time, move from local governance on websites and platforms, to internet governance, and possibly eventually govern people and activities in the real world. None of the solutions in this domain are apparent yet, and I aim to discover them alongside the others in the field who are interested in doing so. It is for this reason that I have begun my journey to become a software engineer. I am still at the beginning of this journey, but it is one I intend to finish.</p>\n<h3><strong>First Project</strong></h3>\nFor my first application build as a software developer, I decided to follow my interests and become familiar with an elementary application of cryptocurrency data. My application is more of a user interface with the endpoint data of cryptocurrencies than anything having to do with the blockchain itself. Still, beginning to familiarize myself with <a href=\"https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api\">nomics</a>, a popular crypto-data API, allowed me to practice my new skills as a ruby developer by building a CLI cryptocurrency portfolio and tracker. My application will enable you to store a portfolio, receive real-time data for many cryptocurrencies, and query different information about each of these currencies.</p>\nBuilding this simple application taught me a great deal about software engineering and cryptocurrencies. I had to research and deepen my understanding of many core concepts central to the data I was collecting. I chose this project to empower myself to gain a deeper understanding of the world of crypto and begin to be able to write code that interfaces with this world. I look forward to building several more projects in my pursuit of discovering the technology that will lead our world towards a better system of collective decision-making in the quest for harmony, equity, and abundance for all people.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=df217bc9675d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

        "content":"Universal Basic Income is the policy of providing every person in a society with money from the government every month, no strings attached. It is a policy that is becoming increasingly popular and may serve as a key to a prosperous, poverty-free future for human civilization. Critics of this policy argue that it’s not possible, viable, or financially responsible. They ask where the funds would come from and who would foot the bill. They are right to ask these questions; they are important ones that beg an answer. Until very recently in human history, there would not have been answers to these questions. Modern technology, automation, and a new type of economic entity that I have termed a wealth aggregator are the modern answers to these questions. Modern tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have been able to aggregate their wealth in an unprecedented and radical way. Our government should fund Universal Basic Income from the excess wealth generated by these companies, which function as wealth aggregators.",

This allows candidates up and down the ballot to lean further into the most extreme viewpoints of their party and deters them from engaging in practical, solutions-oriented dialogue about the issues we collectively face. The advent of social media has not helped this situation. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/572002-how-social-media-fuels-us-political-polarization-what-to-do-about-it\">Research</a> has revealed that the fastest and easiest way to engage users on social media platforms is to appeal to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack#:~:text=An%20amygdala%20hijack%20is%20an,Can%20Matter%20More%20Than%20IQ.\">users’ limbic systems</a>. In other words, to make them angry.</p>\nThe easiest way to make people angry is to make them believe that something has been taken away from them. Our sense of justice is intimately tied to our sense of what we have, own, or have owed to us. By appealing to the past, political operatives on both sides appeal to the extreme and moderate wings of their parties at the deepest levels of their psychology and physiology. These politicians state, “there was something that you used to have, and<strong><em> those people</em></strong><em> </em>took it away from you! Vote for me, and you can get it back.” This logic is flawed. There never truly <em>was</em> a great time or a better to build back to, even though it may have seemed that way from various vantage points.</p>\nAs long as we continue appealing to the past for political ends, we will continue to be divided. Our differing values and desires and our personal, regional, and national versions of history diverge to a huge degree. Ask an economically struggling 40-year old man from Alabama and a wealthy 25-year-old woman from san-Francisco about their family histories, and you will hear vastly different versions of what the past looked like, change the economic status, birthplace, age, race, etc. of either of these individuals and the answers you get will continue to diverge even more.

It is a chaotic and beautiful symphony, and if there’s one thing we can be absolutely certain of, it is this; the future will look <em>absolutely nothing</em> like the past. There is nothing from the past that will happen “again.” There is nothing from the past that can be “built back.” Why would you build a model T when you can have a Tesla? You wouldn’t. So as our political duopoly continues to reinforce the same old tropes that they have spouted for the past century or so, the population is becoming increasingly disillusioned. We want a democratic governing body that is aware of and able to confront the challenges we now face as a civilization.

This encourages open dialogue and intellectual honesty among the candidates, seeking to inspire the middle, rather than pandering to the extreme wing of any given party. Ranked-choice final-five voting means that the top five candidates who receive the most votes in the primary election are ranked by voters. This type of voting encourages candidates to maintain clean races, as negative remarks can hurt your chances of being ranked second or third by supporters of a different candidate.

These reforms would discourage candidates from appealing to the extreme minority of voters in order to keep their elected position. Changing the structure of elections in this way sits upstream of nearly every other important issue of our time. This modern innovation on an outdated system of government is vital if our democracy seeks to continue.

This has been proven by the political duopoly. Meanwhile, the future is approaching at an ever-increasing pace. The only thing everyone seems to be able to agree on is that one fact. It is in this fact that the wisdom of the Forward Party shines. We cannot solve our problems by harkening to some long-lost fantasy of times that never were. The only way to solve the modern problems we face is through collectively imagining a vision of a better future and working tirelessly towards it. What will that future look like?

Ideas are the foundation of human existence. Everything we experience in our lives that is not a natural part of the world began as an idea. This is true from the simple inventions, like the wheel, to the exceedingly complex technologies that have become common place in our modern world.</p>\nMechanical ideas become technologies that influence and impact our lives in various ways. These ideas are powerful and our societies have set up protections that ensure our ideas, and particularly the ones that we are able to bring into actualized form, are connected to their originators. These precautions allow ideas to flourish as real things. Websites, computers, cars, planes, and everything else are able to move from the realm of ideas to the realm of real, concrete items.</p>\nPolitical ideas are different from mechanical ones; they are. Reflections of cultural inclinations, and there is a rich, deep history of their discussion, debate, and consequence ranging back to ancient times. The study of political philosophy was formally introduced by the early Greek philosophers; Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, to name a few. These same philosophers were, interestingly, simultaneously the originators of what we now regard as scientific thought. Aristotle wrote equally prolifically on the categorization of different modes of scientific endeavor as he did on the philosophical underpinnings of the various types of possible political systems; ranging from tyrannical dictatorships, to democratic and free societies.</p>\nThese masterful inquisitors into the realm of ideas recognized and understood the need to think deeply and at length about the world they wished to bring into being, weighing the caveats and pitfalls of all possible types of social organization. Plato goes so far, in his <em>republic</em>, to conceptualize an ideal state; a true utopia that places ideas, and those most capable of parsing and understanding them, philosophically minded people, at the center of the political discourse. The republic Plato crafts in his masterwork heavily implies that the important and vital function of a state is to train those capable of understanding and contemplating ideas in the craft of just that. It is from this place, he posits, that the best leadership will arise; the leadership that does not wish to lead for any other reason than the love of and service to the best ideas that serve the best aims of the society at large.</p>\nThis wonderful ideal, unfortunately, is not represented in modern forms of democracy. Modern democracy places an emphasis on politicians, polarizing incidents, and sensationalized media stories about these politicians and incidents. Rarely in the public discourse is there any actual discussion about ideas, about what a good society would look like, and how we would get there. Look to social media, and you find this problem multiplied; people are often likely to turn to their feeds to tell one another why they are wrong to react a certain way, or to share support around a uniting story regardless of the intellectual merit of the story they are supporting. Again, in these cases, the presence of ideas; of clear and concrete solutions to the problems that seemingly plague our society, is absent.</p>\n<h3><strong>Policies: ideas for action.</strong></h3>\nPolicies are political ideas that are capable of being carried out by governmental bodies in order to serve the population of a given country. These policies generally fall into two categories; active, and passive. Active policies induce action on the part of the government. They are ideas such as “the protection of citizens from harm,” “universal health care,” or “ban the use of a particular harmful substance.” These policies appeal to various degrees to different people for various reasons, and there may be extreme variance in the acceptance of any or all of these types of ideas throughout a layered and complex society such as those that exist in most modern countries. Too often, however, we are subjected to hearing media personalities and politicians debate over the merits of particular policies, while doing little to take the pulse of the general population in terms of their preference for these policies. In a democratic society, lawmakers are meant to serve their constituents, instituting policies and protocols that serve both the interests and desires of the general population.</p>\nToday, everyone has access to the information in abundance. We are all a few keystrokes away from knowing whatever it is that we desire to know. Throughout our history, we left policymaking to the lawmakers because we could be reasonably confident that they were more clearheaded, capable, and knowledgeable about the actual political solutions- the policies- that could serve us, their constituents. We would elect officials based upon their expertise, character, education, and ideas. Though not perfect, this effectively solved the problem of how to arrive at, and institute, good political actions.</p>\nThis system has worked for a long time, but the increase in available information has precipitated its breakdown. Lawmakers no longer know more than the general population; their expertise has become specific and their idea generation has become inadequate to serve the needs of our modern society. While our collective attention is still focused upon these individuals who we have elected to move our society forward, we have lost the thread of our collective narrative, which is the true place from which ideas spring forth.</p>\n<h3><strong>Better ideas from collective intelligence:</strong></h3>\nThe only way we come to new ideas, and thereby better ways of serving everyone in our society, is through careful, reasoned engagement with those ideas. In our democratic society, we should all be able to voice our ideas, imagine how the world may be better, and suggest concrete action that can be taken towards that betterment. By placing ideas at the center of our discourse, we move away from obsessing over the people who implement them, we disconnect our identities from narrowly defined groups and begin to think for ourselves and engage with ideas for ourselves.</p>\nIf we were to place ideas at the center of our political and social discourse, we would be able, through careful discussion and dialogue, to negotiate new policies and ideas. We could find agreement where previously there only existed identity-driven dissent. We could engage in thought experiments that would lead to concrete action; to actual policies being instituted. We could drive progress where possible, and hold back unreasoned and ill-defined ideas until they had been given their due diligence. Building a political culture with ideas at the center would lead to a greatness of those ideas. Just as placing ideas at the center of science, and the academy, has led to the technological marvels that are commonplace in our modern society.</p>\n<h3><strong>Building an infrastructure for ideas:</strong></h3>\nUntil today, this type of open discourse within a society was not possible. The best that could be managed at any given time was for a relatively small number of people to gather in university halls, town halls, or religious centers to swap, discuss, and debate their ideas. It is only in the last decade and a half, with the rise of social media, modern internet protocols, and other communications technologies that we are able to discuss, debate, and dialogue about ideas collectively; with everyone else at the same time. This has caused discord and chaos, but it has the potential to cause the opposite: harmony and order. What must be discovered is the mechanism by which the latter state can be attained.</p>\nIt is this question I seek to answer: how can we collectively discuss and dialogue about ideas online in a way that increases harmony and order? I am a firm believer in incremental improvement towards a goal. As a programmer, it is important to fail fast, break things, and try again until the desired result is achieved. Even then it may be prudent to seek flaws in one’s program or logic, and attempt to fix them. It is in this spirit that I set about my first attempt at answering my question in the most basic way possible; by creating a Sinatra MVC app to store, discuss, and support various policies, and positions for, or against those policies. This, my Minimum Viable Product towards my end goal is, I hope, an extremely early iteration of what will eventually be a far more robust and functional web app dedicated to sharing ideas, placing those ideas at the center of political conversation, and working towards the realization of those ideas in actual policy positions held by lawmakers at the behest of the collective.</p>\nIt is time that we, as a society begin experimenting with new ways of sharing ideas and acting on those ideas in the form of policy-based action. If great minds discuss ideas, then a society that holds the discussion of ideas as sacred is one filled with great minds and is thereby a great society. It is no secret that there is work to be done if we wish to imagine and build a better future for everyone, which is certainly the goal of anyone who genuinely cares about curing the social ills of today. The best way I can see to begin this work is by sitting down and discussing, together, what that better future looks like, and what policies we must institute in order to get there.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=66f21fd74023\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

By placing ideas at the center of our discourse, we move away from obsessing over the people who implement them, we disconnect our identities from narrowly defined groups and begin to think for ourselves and engage with ideas for ourselves.</p>\nIf we were to place ideas at the center of our political and social discourse, we would be able, through careful discussion and dialogue, to negotiate new policies and ideas. We could find agreement where previously there only existed identity-driven dissent. We could engage in thought experiments that would lead to concrete action; to actual policies being instituted. We could drive progress where possible, and hold back unreasoned and ill-defined ideas until they had been given their due diligence. Building a political culture with ideas at the center would lead to a greatness of those ideas. Just as placing ideas at the center of science, and the academy, has led to the technological marvels that are commonplace in our modern society.</p>\n<h3><strong>Building an infrastructure for ideas:</strong></h3>\nUntil today, this type of open discourse within a society was not possible. The best that could be managed at any given time was for a relatively small number of people to gather in university halls, town halls, or religious centers to swap, discuss, and debate their ideas. It is only in the last decade and a half, with the rise of social media, modern internet protocols, and other communications technologies that we are able to discuss, debate, and dialogue about ideas collectively; with everyone else at the same time. This has caused discord and chaos, but it has the potential to cause the opposite: harmony and order. What must be discovered is the mechanism by which the latter state can be attained.</p>\nIt is this question I seek to answer: how can we collectively discuss and dialogue about ideas online in a way that increases harmony and order? I am a firm believer in incremental improvement towards a goal. As a programmer, it is important to fail fast, break things, and try again until the desired result is achieved. Even then it may be prudent to seek flaws in one’s program or logic, and attempt to fix them. It is in this spirit that I set about my first attempt at answering my question in the most basic way possible; by creating a Sinatra MVC app to store, discuss, and support various policies, and positions for, or against those policies. This, my Minimum Viable Product towards my end goal is, I hope, an extremely early iteration of what will eventually be a far more robust and functional web app dedicated to sharing ideas, placing those ideas at the center of political conversation, and working towards the realization of those ideas in actual policy positions held by lawmakers at the behest of the collective.</p>\nIt is time that we, as a society begin experimenting with new ways of sharing ideas and acting on those ideas in the form of policy-based action. If great minds discuss ideas, then a society that holds the discussion of ideas as sacred is one filled with great minds and is thereby a great society. It is no secret that there is work to be done if we wish to imagine and build a better future for everyone, which is certainly the goal of anyone who genuinely cares about curing the social ills of today. The best way I can see to begin this work is by sitting down and discussing, together, what that better future looks like, and what policies we must institute in order to get there.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=66f21fd74023\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

        "description": "\nI recently embarked upon a project to create an application that allows people to create and share courses based upon already existing youtube content- as a way for autodidacts to better structure their autodidacticism and help others who wish to do the same. To do this, I needed to figure out how to get videos off of youtube, and into my application. I found this process rather opaque, and difficult to figure out, and figured I would write an article to help any others who may wish to venture this way in the future.</p>\n<h3>Setup: search and request.</h3>\nYoutube has a robust api that can be accessed <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\">here</a>. Functionally, this API is robust and intuitive, but getting to the point where you can easily make calls to this api is a different story, and depending on what you need, there are a few different ways of accessing information from the API. No matter how you intend to use the API, you need to start by obtaining an API key.</p>\nIf you are creating an application that only wants to read from youtube(ie. you are not posting any content to the site), then you can get away with using a simple API key, you can do this from the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials\">credentials page</a> of your google cloud developer account. If you are looking for more complex functionality, you need to set up Oauth credentialization which allows users to sign into their own google account from your site in order to upload content to youtube as themselves. I will not be covering this is this article, as I did not set it up for my application. Once you have your API key saved in a “.env” file in your root directory as a global ENV[“API_KEY”] variable, you’re ready to begin setup to read from the youtube API.</p>\n<h3>Yt Gem</h3>\nI used the “<a href=\"https://github.com/nullscreen/yt\">YT gem</a>” to help me access API content such as video information, details, and url links. I initialized the gem in an initializer file, which implements some behavior upon the initial boot of the application.</p>\n<pre>require 'yt'<br><br><br>puts ENV['YOUTUBE_API_KEY']<br>Yt.configure do |config|<br>    config.api_key = ENV['YOUTUBE_API_KEY']<br>    config.log_level = :debug<br>endr</pre>\nThen I had to figure out how to access videos. This gem only works to access videos by id- the string of numbers and letters at the end of a youtube URL. It can then return all sorts of information about the video, its comments, its creator, and so on. I used this functionality to add videos to lessons in my application by their id. I gave my videos two seperate URL strings, “url” links to the video on youtube, and “embed_url” gives a link that I can embed in an “iFrame” html component in my react front end to make the video viewable on my own site.</p>\n<pre> ytvideo = Yt::Video.new id: id<br> video = lesson.videos.create(<br>url: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=#{id}\", <br>embed_url: \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/#{id}\", <br>title: ytvideo.snippet.data[\"title\"], <br>channel: ytvideo.snippet.data[\"channelTitle\"], <br>description: ytvideo.snippet.data[\"description\"], <br>thumbnail: ytvideo.snippet.data[\"thumbnails\"][\"medium\"][\"url\"])</pre>\n<h3>Search</h3>\nOne piece of functionality that this gem does not have, however, is searching youtube for a list of videos matching a search query which, as you can see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search\">here</a>, is a feature of the API. In order to get the id’s for creating new videos with the Yt gem, i needed to find some way to allow people to search for videos from a simple text prompt from within my application. In order to implement this, I needed to make a basic call to the “search” endpoint of the youtube API using the “<a href=\"https://github.com/ruby/net-http\">net-http</a>” ruby gem. This allowed me to create a simple http request that returned a list of five videos related to the search term.</p>\n<pre> def search<br>        key = ENV[\"YOUTUBE_API_KEY\"]<br>        search = params[:search]<br>        uri = URI('https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search')<br>        params = {:key =&gt; key, :part =&gt; 'snippet', :q=&gt;search, :type=&gt;'video'}<br>        uri.query = URI.encode_www_form(params)<br><br>        response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)<br>       render json: response.body<br>    end</pre>\nI could then use this response to send the Id’s of any selected video back to the earlier route in order to save and store it as a video in my applicaiton.</p>\nAfter many hours I got both of these routes working on the backend, and successfully learned how to navigate the Youtube API.</p>\n<h3>Result</h3>\nThe result is an application that allows users to both search for videos and add them to any given lesson in their course.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*o5BNM-Bj4zHQjH1-nmGR4A.png\"></figure>I’m pretty proud of this application, and looking forward to continue building it into a full-fledged course website.

        "description": "\nI built an application that allows you to call the Google Books API and use the resultant data to save your personal library saved in a JSON server.</p>\nBuilding this application was relatively straightforward. Calling the api, using Javascript to render the information and data on the screen, building a JSON server to mock the storage of information and persist that information upon a refresh or reload of the application were all enjoyable if mildly challenging problems to solve.</p>\nI integrated several features into the application, allowing for the display and saving of books in a simple UI.</p>\n<h3>A Simple Library Application:</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*utxSlon5cSvftrzw3X1RhA.png\"></figure>I accomplished this by building multiple DIV elements in the HTML, using event listeners to build the buttons, and several objects to persist the data.</p>\nThen, I wanted to build some stars, so that users could add a rating to the books they had saved in their library. This proved more difficult than I had initially thought, and it took some serious thinking to work out how to make these stars work properly.</p>\nHere is how I did it.</p>\nFirst, I had to make the elements, I built a function to append the stars to the container element that held the information on any given book. This gave me an array full of span elements whose inner text was set to the value of the empty star glyph.</p>\nThen, I added an event listener that took a callback function to each of the stars, calling the function each time my event — a click — occurred.</p>\nI quickly realized that I needed to find a way to get the siblings of this star, the stars that come before and after it, if i wished to create a working set of highlightable stars. To accomplish this, I wrote two more functions:</p>\n<pre>function getPreviousSiblings(element, siblings =[]){</pre>\n<pre>siblings = []</pre>\n<pre>while(element = element.previousElementSibling){</pre>\n<pre>siblings.push(element);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>return siblings</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\nand</p>\n<pre>function getNextSiblings(element){</pre>\n<pre>siblings = []</pre>\n<pre>while(element = element.nextElementSibling){</pre>\n<pre>siblings.push(element)</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>return siblings</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\nThese operate on a global siblings variable that i have set at the beginning of the application, and use a while loop to add either the previous siblings of the target element, or the ones that follow it to the siblings array.</p>\nThen I set about making my callback function; what the click would do:</p>\n<pre><em>function starRating(e){</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const star = e.target;</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const previousStars = getPreviousSiblings(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const nextStars = getNextSiblings(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>console.log(nextStars)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>if(star.innerText === emptyStar){</em></pre>\n<pre><em>previousStars.unshift(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>previousStars.forEach(s =&gt; {</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.innerText=fullStar</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.className=”activated-star”})</em></pre>\n<pre><em>} else {</em></pre>\n<pre><em>nextStars.unshift(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>nextStars.forEach(s=&gt;{</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.innerText = emptyStar</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.className = “star-glyph”</em></pre>\n<pre><em>})}}</em></pre>\nIn this function, e is the event, and e.target is the star that is clicked. It uses my earlier previous and next siblings functions to get those elements, and the checks wether the clicked upon star is empty or full. If it is empty, it iterates over all the the stars that come before it, filling them in, and if it is full, it iterates over the stars that come after it, making them empty, thus allowing you to change the rating from between one and five.</p>\nFinally, I fed this function back into my event listener for each star. I still, however, needed a way to persist that information.</p>\n<pre>function createStars(bookObj){</pre>\n<pre>const bookStars = document.createElement('div')</pre>\n<pre>bookStars.className = \"book-stars\"</pre>\n<pre>for(var i = 0; i&lt;5; i++){</pre>\n<pre>const bookStar = document.createElement(\"span\")</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.className = \"star-glyph\"</pre>\n<pre><strong>bookStar.id = `${i+1}`</strong></pre>\n<pre>if(i &lt; bookObj.stars){</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.innerHTML = fullStar</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.className = \"activated-star\"</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>else{bookStar.innerHTML=('☆')}</pre>\n<pre>bookStars.appendChild(bookStar)</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.addEventListener(\"click\",(e)=&gt;{</pre>\n<pre>const starId = e.target.id</pre>\n<pre>starRating(e)</pre>\n<pre>if(e.target.className == \"activated-star\"){</pre>\n<pre><strong>bookObj.stars = starId</strong></pre>\n<pre><strong>updateLibraryBook(bookObj)</strong></pre>\n<pre>}else{</pre>\n<pre>bookObj.stars = 0</pre>\n<pre>updateLibraryBook(bookObj)</pre>\n<pre>}})}</pre>\n<pre>return bookStars}</pre>\nTo accomplish this, in the above function which creates the stars, i give each star an ID which is just a number of 1 through 5, this is set when the stars are created at the beginning of the function. Then, I gave my event listener multiple functionalities, by giving my callback function a single parameter of “e”. I feed the event into the above “starRating” function, that operates on the functionality of the stars on the page, while being able to also persist e.target.id (the number of the star) to my bookObj object, which is passed in from the function that builds the entire card that displays the book, and is pulled from my JSON library.

        "content": "\nI built an application that allows you to call the Google Books API and use the resultant data to save your personal library saved in a JSON server.</p>\nBuilding this application was relatively straightforward. Calling the api, using Javascript to render the information and data on the screen, building a JSON server to mock the storage of information and persist that information upon a refresh or reload of the application were all enjoyable if mildly challenging problems to solve.</p>\nI integrated several features into the application, allowing for the display and saving of books in a simple UI.</p>\n<h3>A Simple Library Application:</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*utxSlon5cSvftrzw3X1RhA.png\"></figure>I accomplished this by building multiple DIV elements in the HTML, using event listeners to build the buttons, and several objects to persist the data.</p>\nThen, I wanted to build some stars, so that users could add a rating to the books they had saved in their library. This proved more difficult than I had initially thought, and it took some serious thinking to work out how to make these stars work properly.</p>\nHere is how I did it.</p>\nFirst, I had to make the elements, I built a function to append the stars to the container element that held the information on any given book. This gave me an array full of span elements whose inner text was set to the value of the empty star glyph.</p>\nThen, I added an event listener that took a callback function to each of the stars, calling the function each time my event — a click — occurred.</p>\nI quickly realized that I needed to find a way to get the siblings of this star, the stars that come before and after it, if i wished to create a working set of highlightable stars. To accomplish this, I wrote two more functions:</p>\n<pre>function getPreviousSiblings(element, siblings =[]){</pre>\n<pre>siblings = []</pre>\n<pre>while(element = element.previousElementSibling){</pre>\n<pre>siblings.push(element);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>return siblings</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\nand</p>\n<pre>function getNextSiblings(element){</pre>\n<pre>siblings = []</pre>\n<pre>while(element = element.nextElementSibling){</pre>\n<pre>siblings.push(element)</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>return siblings</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\nThese operate on a global siblings variable that i have set at the beginning of the application, and use a while loop to add either the previous siblings of the target element, or the ones that follow it to the siblings array.</p>\nThen I set about making my callback function; what the click would do:</p>\n<pre><em>function starRating(e){</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const star = e.target;</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const previousStars = getPreviousSiblings(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>const nextStars = getNextSiblings(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>console.log(nextStars)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>if(star.innerText === emptyStar){</em></pre>\n<pre><em>previousStars.unshift(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>previousStars.forEach(s =&gt; {</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.innerText=fullStar</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.className=”activated-star”})</em></pre>\n<pre><em>} else {</em></pre>\n<pre><em>nextStars.unshift(star)</em></pre>\n<pre><em>nextStars.forEach(s=&gt;{</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.innerText = emptyStar</em></pre>\n<pre><em>s.className = “star-glyph”</em></pre>\n<pre><em>})}}</em></pre>\nIn this function, e is the event, and e.target is the star that is clicked. It uses my earlier previous and next siblings functions to get those elements, and the checks wether the clicked upon star is empty or full. If it is empty, it iterates over all the the stars that come before it, filling them in, and if it is full, it iterates over the stars that come after it, making them empty, thus allowing you to change the rating from between one and five.</p>\nFinally, I fed this function back into my event listener for each star. I still, however, needed a way to persist that information.</p>\n<pre>function createStars(bookObj){</pre>\n<pre>const bookStars = document.createElement('div')</pre>\n<pre>bookStars.className = \"book-stars\"</pre>\n<pre>for(var i = 0; i&lt;5; i++){</pre>\n<pre>const bookStar = document.createElement(\"span\")</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.className = \"star-glyph\"</pre>\n<pre><strong>bookStar.id = `${i+1}`</strong></pre>\n<pre>if(i &lt; bookObj.stars){</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.innerHTML = fullStar</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.className = \"activated-star\"</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>else{bookStar.innerHTML=('☆')}</pre>\n<pre>bookStars.appendChild(bookStar)</pre>\n<pre>bookStar.addEventListener(\"click\",(e)=&gt;{</pre>\n<pre>const starId = e.target.id</pre>\n<pre>starRating(e)</pre>\n<pre>if(e.target.className == \"activated-star\"){</pre>\n<pre><strong>bookObj.stars = starId</strong></pre>\n<pre><strong>updateLibraryBook(bookObj)</strong></pre>\n<pre>}else{</pre>\n<pre>bookObj.stars = 0</pre>\n<pre>updateLibraryBook(bookObj)</pre>\n<pre>}})}</pre>\n<pre>return bookStars}</pre>\nTo accomplish this, in the above function which creates the stars, i give each star an ID which is just a number of 1 through 5, this is set when the stars are created at the beginning of the function. Then, I gave my event listener multiple functionalities, by giving my callback function a single parameter of “e”. I feed the event into the above “starRating” function, that operates on the functionality of the stars on the page, while being able to also persist e.target.id (the number of the star) to my bookObj object, which is passed in from the function that builds the entire card that displays the book, and is pulled from my JSON library. I am then able to use the number of the star, and add it to the book object as an integer through a patch request sent to my server. Finally, when a book is created, it operates on the stars to fill the number of stars that was previously saved in the server.</p>\nThis problem proved more difficult to solve than I had initially imagined, and gave me the opportunity to learn about thinking through the various elements of the DOM, and how they can work together and dynamically effect one another. I look forward to continuing to improve my skills with the DOM, and think through increasingly challenging problems like this in the future.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=17e6ea92178a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

        "description": "\nI, like the many other denizens of the internet in the past several weeks, found myself fascinated by chatGPT, so much potential for change and growth comes with the advent of this technology, and leveraging it to build novel applications is truly an exciting prospect. As I was approaching building my capstone project for Flatiron School, I thought that there would be no better technology to explore and implement than the GPT API, an api that allows one to access the language models developed by OpenAI for programmatic use in your own applications.</p>\nI wanted to build an application that leveraged the openAI api to help users explore and build their own courses in any given area they wish. the powerful thing about using LLM’s to do this, is it enables you to have an instantaneous learning plan for what subjects to tackle in order to learn any given subject. Often the hardest part of learning something new is knowing where to start, and how to search the large volume of information on the internet in order to follow the right steps to go from clueless to understanding. Dialogium solves this problem by providing users with a clear lesson plan, and giving them the ability to search youtube for videos relevant to learning each topic in that plan.</p>\n<h3>Learning OpenAI API</h3>\nThe first challenge I tackled when beginning this project was learning how to make use of OpenAI’s robust API. One of the requirements for my final project was learning and using a new technology, and this API more than fulfills this requirement. I had to learn the meaning of “temperature” when querying large language models, how to engineer a prompt that returns data in a format that is easy to parse and use in your application, and finally how to parse the prompt such that it creates consistent data to be passed to the models and views of my final application. The result is an amazing workflow that generates courses in seconds.</p>\n<h3>Temperature</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CZJsFEnHisiSUUEkliiGyw.png\"></figure>Temperature is a vital parameter for building applicaitons with the OpenAI API as it determines the randomness of the response you will recieve. In some cases, a higher degree of variance is preferable, if you were generating a fictional story, for example. In my case, I needed uniform responses to be generated, meaning that they did not vary far from the prompt that I gave to the system, but also took some liberty in building courses, so that I didn’t have several users generating the exact same course plans over and over again. I used temperature 0.5, and this seemed to work very well to generate a consistently formatted response, with some degree of variation in the actual output if i query the model for the same subject matter more than once.</p>\n<h3>Prompt Engineering:</h3>\nThe next challenge to tackle was the engineering of the actual prompt, I needed to learn over several iteratinos how to ask for what i wanted in order to get a uniform response that oculd be parsed in the same way each time. I was asking for a course broken up into sections and lessons on a given topic. The response generates the framework for a course in my final application, that users can then add to, update, and change around to serve their own purposes.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/752/1*SYcyK0FKKSpi6zYC4-I7vg.png\"><figcaption>Prompt Generated Course.</figcaption></figure>This is the prompt that I arrived at that consistently returns my requested information:</p>\n<blockquote>‘Generate a course syllabus of nine lessons for’+ params[:topic] +’such that I would have a basic understanding of the topic upon completion of the course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Separate the course into three sections of three lessons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Include a real and, to the best of your knowledge active link to a youtube video that covers the topic for each lesson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Format the syllabus in the following way:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Title: `Course Title`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Section 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Lesson A:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Name: `Lesson Name`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Subject: `Lesson Subject`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Video: `Youtube video title`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Channel: `Youtube video Channel`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Link: `Youtube Video Link`</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(Continue with lessons B and C for each section)(ONLY write “Sections” and “Lessons” as “Section 1:”, “Lesson A:”, etc, DO NOT include any further text to the line upon which those important keywords appear.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Repeat this formatting for all the sections and lessons for’+params[:topic]+’</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If more subject matter is required in order to have a basic understanding of’ + params[:topic]+’,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Include a final section labled “Section 4” with any relevent information you think is nessecary for a complete basic understanding of’ + params[:topic]+’.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Please follow the requested formatting exactly as it appears. Thank you.’</blockquote>\nAs you can see, I had to get extremely specific in asking for how I wanted the course to be formatted in order to return consistent data on each request. The specificity of this data remained extremely important when parsing the returned data.</p>\nThe response of the openAI API is not parseable json to the degree of specificity necessary to parse what is inside the response, so I had to develop a custom “parse_completion” method that allowed me to pull out all of the returned information based on specific markers in my returned text, such as “section(section number) and lesson(lesson letter).”</p>\n<pre>def parse_completion<br>        parsed_response={}<br>        lines = self.text.split(\"\\n\")<br>        new_lines = lines.map do |line|<br>            new_line = line.strip<br>            new_line<br>        end<br>        #new_lines.compact_blank<br>        lines_to_split = new_lines.compact_blank<br>        #puts lines_to_split<br>        title = lines_to_split.shift<br>        parsed_response[:title] = title<br>        parsed_response[:course] = find_sections(lines_to_split)<br>        #puts parsed_response<br>        return parsed_response<br>    end</pre>\n<h3>Parsing Data</h3>\nUsing several private methods, I parse my response into a useable object (parsed response). I then use this parsed response to generate all the sections and lessons of the course my user wants to generate:</p>\n<pre> def self.generate_course_from_completion(parsed_completion, user_id, topic)<br>        title = parsed_completion[:title]<br>        oneA = parsed_completion[:course][:section1][:lesson_a]<br>        oneB = parsed_completion[:course][:section1][:lesson_b]<br>        oneC = parsed_completion[:course][:section1][:lesson_c]<br>        section_2 = parsed_completion[:course][:section2]<br>        twoA = parsed_completion[:course][:section2][:lesson_a]<br>        twoB = parsed_completion[:course][:section2][:lesson_b]<br>        twoC = parsed_completion[:course][:section2][:lesson_c]<br>        section_3 = parsed_completion[:course][:section3]<br>        threeA = parsed_completion[:course][:section3][:lesson_a]<br>        threeB = parsed_completion[:course][:section3][:lesson_b]<br>        threeC = parsed_completion[:course][:section3][:lesson_c]<br><br>        course = Course.create(title: title, user_id: user_id, topic: topic)<br><br>        s1 = course.sections.create(number: 1)<br>        s2 = course.sections.create(number: 2)<br>        s3 = course.sections.create(number: 3)<br><br>       l1a = s1.lessons.create(name: oneA[:name], subject: oneA[:subject])<br>       l1b = s1.lessons.create(name: oneB[:name], subject: oneB[:subject])<br>       l1c = s1.lessons.create(name: oneC[:name], subject: oneC[:subject])<br>       l2a = s2.lessons.create(name: twoA[:name], subject: twoA[:subject])<br>       l2b = s2.lessons.create(name: twoB[:name], subject: twoB[:subject])<br>       l2c = s2.lessons.create(name: twoC[:name], subject: twoC[:subject])<br>       l3a = s3.lessons.create(name: threeA[:name], subject: threeA[:subject])<br>       l3b = s3.lessons.create(name: threeB[:name], subject: threeB[:subject])<br>       l3c = s3.lessons.create(name: threeC[:name], subject: threeC[:subject])<br>end</pre>\nUsing these methods, with a single click, a user can instantly generate the framework for an entire course (pictured above).</p>\n<h3>Building the Application</h3>\nOnce I figured out how to allow users to create courses, and had seeded a couple of courses of my own, I was ready to build the rest of the application. This involved querying the Youtube API to allow users to add videos to the lessons that the prompt generated, and creating models and controllers on the back end for courses, lessons, users, and videos to allow users to interact with the created courses, decide to take the course, add lessons, videos, and courses to the site, and interact with other users who are fellow students, and creators of the various courses on the site.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UEkGkfMKFzOBPH11EyeTNQ.png\"></figure>In my React frontend, I used Material UI to handle styling, generating a clean and clear user interface.

Software rules our lives. It’s what allows you to read these words and me to print them. It is both the cause of and solution to many of the problems that plague our modern world. I want to build a more equitable, fair, bright, and beautiful world than the one we currently inhabit. The problems we face are not going anywhere. Rampant climate change, increasingly polarizing political movements and a breakdown of our collective sensemaking structures are leading us increasingly towards a bleak future that many have predicted. I see a different way. I believe that the solutions to all of these problems lie in embracing our modern technologies and using them to their fullest possible extent.</p>\n<p>Call me a techno-utopian, but the way I see it, we only have two options. We can learn to build a beautiful world that works for even the most oppressed among us <em>with</em> the technologies that we have at our disposal, or do away with all of these modern marvels and regress to a previous era rife with suffering and poverty. I believe that the former vision of the future exists and that it is by careful envisioning and concrete planning that we will create it.</p>\n<h3>Questions, Not Answers</h3>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy\">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a>” is a favorite book of mine — a favorite I likely share with many technologists and futurists. This book wraps philosophy in a humorous narrative and suggests a fundamental and unique worldview that is important for building a better future. The book suggests that the most important thing we can do to solve “the problems of the universe and the meaning of life” is to ask the right questions. Famously, a computer designed in the book to answer the meaning of life results with the cryptic and seemingly irrelevant number “42” after centuries of computation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dmsuAA8tHfmb2z8RLkJOUA.jpeg\"></figure><p>The question that provided that answer, the computer proposes, is much more important than the solution itself and would take even <em>more</em> time to compute and return. This critical insight: that questions are more important than, and superior to answers, has been the driving force of industry, technology, and radical transformation throughout history. Innovators are always asking questions such as “how can I make x better,” “what is y made of,” and “how do I do z.” The answers to these questions are all around us. They are so relevant that we often take them for granted as they dissolve into the status-quo of “how things are.” It is not the answers that drive society forward. It is the questions.</p>\n<h3>The Problems of Today</h3>\n<p>I have spent much of my free time contemplating our civilization and planet’s problems. I have inquired into the nature of reality, the forces that drive our society, and the possible ways to improve that society rather than degrade it. As far as building a better future goes, various organizations have already created solutions to building an abundant world. These solutions exist in <a href=\"http://www.green-technology.org/\">green technology</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">communication</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\"> logistical and supply-chain enhancement</a>, among others.</p>\n<p>These technologies will be vital to the building of a cleaner, greener, and more beautiful world. The rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrency</a> and the overpowering nature of social media are influential players still in their infancy, and social media seems to be currently causing more problems than it has solved. Nonetheless, these technologies exist, and it is up to us to figure out what to do with them and how to make them best serve us.</p>\n<p>When I ask questions about our modern world, one problem plagues my mind above all others: the breakdown of our collective ability to make good sense of the world and subsequently make good decisions. Our <a href=\"https://alexander-gould94.medium.com/its-time-to-update-the-machine-of-government-dbaae13d7fc5\">political environment is outdated</a>. It is not technologically empowered. While it still works in principle, it seems that the specific moving parts of our governmental and political system, particularly in America, have broken down nearly beyond repair. It is becoming increasingly apparent that we need clear, consciously thought through plans and technology to improve the American government’s apparatus, restore real democratic power to the people, and demystify our government’s inner workings.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/877/1*TekRU3fyaIK1x73X5USYXw.jpeg\"></figure><p>I do not propose to have all of the solutions. But I am deeply invested in discovering them. I believe that we can find and design better or alternative forms of our current social media platforms. Without traditional monetary incentives, these platforms could help us to focus on the real issues that need solutions in our modern society: those surrounding the fourth industrial revolution, automation, and increased interdependence with both our fellow citizens and our planet. I believe that we can upgrade the mechanisms of democratic government to re-invigorate an emphasis on enacting policy based upon good ideas. Doing this would allow us to steer away from endless debates over cultural issues that divide us and have no clear solution.</p>\n<p>We can collectively form a new kind of technologically empowered and integrated democratic government that increases the sovereignty and agency of every individual who participates fully within that system. Questions of achieving these ends bring forth a wellspring of endless design, speculation, and planning. Through pure imagination, I have begun to contemplate this future. One question remains for me, how will I build it?</p>\n<h3>Technical Frameworks</h3>\n<p>I seek to help build a better future. When asking how I would do this, I faced a few options: I could try to get deeply involved in the current government and create change from within it. I concluded that this path would not work as I don’t believe that structural change to an institution can occur from within that institution. Its value system and structure <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2015/09/unhinging-government-culture-resistant-change/121142/\">resist change</a>. It’s entrenched ways of doing things, and those who enforce that entrenchment are too powerful to enact meaningful change through the existing governmental systems.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I could join and engage with activism’s critical work. Activists seek to use their voices and collective energy to call for change to the system. These individuals and their work are vital and provide a much-needed voice to the voiceless, those who see no other way to fix the problems that plague their lives. I am personally disposed to action rather than discussion. While I have worked with and continue to support activist movements, I recognized that the work of activism is nearly endless. While its results shift the cultural consciousness, which is an essential prerequisite for systemic change, they generally do little to affect the root causes and entrenched power structures that create the problems they seek to change.</p>\n<p>Faced with these two options and wholly dedicated to the work of solving those root causes and dismantling those power structures, I recognized that the only option left to me was to get my hands dirty. To get into the trenches and do the work to shift the power structures, not through the systems they exist within, or by calling out those systems, but by creating technologies and mechanisms that can challenge the root causes of the societies problems, and, by building a better alternative, bring the necessary changes into existence.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*GQac9kx7hegP2sXE4kwxbA.jpeg\"></figure><p>Technologies like Bitcoin, electric vehicles and Amazon (<a href=\"https://alexander-gould94.medium.com/re-defining-monopolies-d49e6a4dc837\">say what you will about them</a>) have done precisely this to existing industries. They have created a <em>better alternative</em> to finance, gasoline-powered cars, and retail shopping. People have naturally migrated to these new technologies. I recognize that the real way to affect change is to <em>be</em> the change. The best thing to do is create a better option and let that option speak for itself: attracting people to it due to its intrinsic virtue and value.</p>\n<p>To build the better options that I believe exist, I need the technical skills to understand and create those options. I know that it will not happen overnight. Still, I am committed to building better political systems than the ones that currently exist. I am confident that developing the correct type of software and web applications will enable me to do that. I aim to learn how to be a software developer to create these systems and interact with and understand others who would share this goal with me.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it is my goal to create a startup and develop software that can help to upgrade both our nation’s political discourse and our government’s functioning. By gaining the technical skills of a software developer, I will begin to develop the systems that I envision. I will seek employment among the cutting-edge of the technological landscape to grow my capabilities until such a time when I am fully ready to embark upon my venture. Further, I will understand the fundamentals of how our modern world works and is evolving to truly understand the questions that we must ask to improve it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=936ddf3f75d4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

      "content":"The government is a vehicle. It gets us from here to there. It was designed masterfully in its time by the founding fathers of the United States to build and grow a democratic nation in pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness for all citizens. We often speak of the ‘body’ of government. In metaphor, we relate our government to ourselves, an organic, evolving entity capable of adaptation to new situations and circumstances. In this article, I am proposing that the government is not, in fact, a body. Our government is a machine, and we have not updated the parts since the constitutional convention in 1787. These updates are necessary if we wish to achieve any level of societal progress. The body of which we speak is the people who serve and create the government. We must do a better job of differentiating between these two distinct aspects of our government and recognize that we are wholly capable of upgrading the mechanical parts of this government when they have become outdated. Further, we must update the mechanical aspects of government if we wish to see any genuine progress in modern social and political life. Mechanical Progress Technology has progressed in the modern world through continuous reiteration and refinement. Continuous advancement has been made possible through this process. The government has fallen behind the radical growth in technology that has occurred in modern times and seems incapable of catching up. For this reason, a serious analysis of government as a machine, and subsequent upgrade of that machine, must be undertaken if we are to solve the most severe social issues that plague our nation.",
